## Labs for CS5361 Machine Learning
This repository contains my submissions/labs for the Fall 2019 CS5361 Machine Learning Course. All resources and provided instructions are provided by the [instructor's site](http://www.cs.utep.edu/ofuentes/cs4361.html).

## Lab 1: K-nearest Neighbors
The `lab1` directory contains the following files:
- `_instr.pdf` which contains the instructions for the assignment
- `knn.py` which is the provided script to modify for building a k-nearest-neighbors predictor model
- `mnist.py` which is the provided script to load the mnist dataset for training/testing
- `zeroR.py` which is the provided script containing a predictor model
- `report.py` which is my submitted report for this assignment
### To Run
Run the `mnist.py` code first. Then, run `knn.py`. See datasets for any additional files required to run the program.
### Datasets
The dataset used for this program is the MNIST dataset and the Solar particle dataset, as provided by the instructor on the course webpage.
### Results
Experimental results for this assignment can be found in [this Google sheets](http://bit.ly/19w_cs5361-results)* document, in the `lab1-knn` sheet.
<br>\*_This document may not be available after the course end date._ 

## Lab 2: Decision Trees
The `lab2` directory contains the following files:
- `magic04.txt` which is the provided dataset
- `decision_tree.py` which is the  provided script to modify for building a decision tree classification model
- `regression_tree.py` which is the provided script to modify for building a decision tree regression model
### To Run
Compile the `decision_tree.py` program or the `regression_tree.py` program, or both to your preference.
### Datasets
The dataset used for this program is provided by the instructor on the course webpage.
### Results
Experimental results for this assignment can be found in [this Google sheets](http://bit.ly/19w_cs5361-results)* document, in the `lab2-dectree` sheet.
